#Ashvatta
##Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a functional framework for a fully
procedurally-generated world.  For starters, this project is going to work
strictly on physical features of landmass (i.e. basic geography).  In the
future, it will encompass a veritable suite of tools for procedurally
generating worlds and everything that goes with it.

##Building
% qmake

% make

% dist/ashvattha

##Right now, however...
+ Let there be noise -- Simplex Noise implemented.  It's not much, but it's a start.
                      - [Explanation](http://www.farfromrobots.com/2012/04/08/working-with-simplex-noise/)
+ Such great heights -- Height and density maps implemented (not yet tested)

##Requirements
The basic library itself will be designed to work in any environment.  However,
to compile my examples and tests, the Qt 4 SDK is required.
