##Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a functional framework for a fully procedurally-generated world.  For starters, this project is going to work strictly on physical features of landmass (i.e. basic geography).  In the future, it will encompass a veritable suite of tools for procedurally generating worlds and everything that goes with it.

##Right now, however...
+ Let there be noise -- Simplex Noise implemented.  It's not much, but it's a start.
                      - Explanation (http://www.farfromrobots.com/2012/04/08/working-with-simplex-noise/)

##Requirements
The basic library itself will be designed to work in any environment.  However, to compile my examples and tests, the Qt 4 SDK is required.
